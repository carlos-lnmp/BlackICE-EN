 # Civilian Economy
 NZL_bi_department_of_housing_construction:0 "Department of Housing Construction"
 NZL_bi_department_of_housing_construction_desc:0 "A policy of the elected government of 1935, we can issue tenders for the mass construction of new homes for our citizens. Such large-scale operations involve standardisation of parts and fittings to a much greater extent than previously seen in our country."
 NZL_bi_public_works_department:0 "Public Works Department"
 NZL_bi_public_works_department_desc:0 "Most public works are being carried out by the Unemployment Board, and focused on the relief of unemployment. We can transfer these to the Public Works Deparment, and expand genuine works activity by importing earth-moving machinery."
 NZL_bi_bureau_of_industry:0 "Bureau of Industry"
 NZL_bi_bureau_of_industry_desc:0 "We want to diversify our economy and increase manufacturing. This new department will encourage the establishment of new industries."
 NZL_bi_highway_construction:0 "Highways and Road Works"
 NZL_bi_highway_construction_desc:0 "We have increased the efficiency of our public works. Now we can expand the Public Works Deparment, and build new roads for our country."
 NZL_bi_import_restrictions:0 "Import Restrictions"
 NZL_bi_import_restrictions_desc:0 "One step we are considering is restricting imports of many manufactured goods, to encourage local manufacturing. This proved haphazard in it's effects, but encouraged many industries that did important work during the war years ahead."
 NZL_bi_diversification_of_economy:0 "Encourage Private Industry"
 NZL_bi_diversification_of_economy_desc:0 "Through government orders and subsidies, we can encourage the development of local manufacturing."
 NZL_bi_power_development:0 "Develop Hydro-Electric Power"
 NZL_bi_power_development_desc:0 "Historically, New Zealand prepared poorly for the increased demand for electrical power from increased industry requirements and reduced imports of fuel. But we have considerable potential to develop more hydro-electrical power to buffer our economy."
 # Technology
 NZL_bi_extra_tech_slot:0 "£tech_mod DSIR"
 NZL_bi_extra_tech_slot_desc:0 "The Department of Science and Industrial Research was established in 1926. We have developed our economy to be more self-sufficient, and new ideas are being created and tested. We can expand the DSIR to carry this further."
 NZL_bi_no_8_wire:0 "No.8 Wire Tradition"
 NZL_bi_no_8_wire_desc:0 "Because we live a great distance away from other countries, from pioneer times our citizens have always had to invent things we could not easily obtain. In 1900 we had the highest number of patent applications per capita in the world. While many of the proposals we are receiving are less than practical, we can harness our tradition of citizen innovation to our advantage."
 NZL_bi_extra_tech_slot_2:0 "£tech_mod Task Universities with Research"
 NZL_bi_extra_tech_slot_2_desc:0 "We can fund various projects to help develop our country further."
 # Social Policy
 NZL_bi_enact_social_policy:0 "Domestic Policy"
 NZL_bi_enact_social_policy_desc:0 "The NZ Labour government of 1935 was elected with a policy to create the western world's first social security system, including free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare."
 NZL_bi_pass_social_security_act:0 "Pass Social Security Act"
 NZL_bi_pass_social_security_act_desc:0 "Combining a comprehensive array of welfare benefits with free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare, the Social Security Act of 1938 was intended to protect New Zealanders from the cradle to the grave. It sustained both a safety net and trust in government during the tough decisions ahead, but critics claimed the welfare state was too expensive and encouraged dependence."
 NZL_bi_maori_volunteers:0 "The Maori Battalion"
 NZL_bi_maori_volunteers_desc:0 "As war seemed inevitable, Sir Apirana Ngata and other Maori leaders proposed the formation of a unit formed from Maori volunteers. The Maori Battalion went on to be the most decorated New Zealand battalion during the war. Historically, almost 16,000 Maori from a population of 100,000 volunteered for service during the war."
 NZL_bi_civilian_manpower_controls:0 "Enact Civilian Manpower Controls"
 NZL_bi_civilian_manpower_controls_desc:0 "Our country has a strong tradition of organised labour. Regulations reducing overtime rates to boost production are meeting overt resistance and strikes. However, restrictions on stopping essential war work have much the same effect and are more accepted, although critics liken them to conscription."
 NZL_bi_pass_the_manpower_act:0 "Pass the Manpower Act"
 NZL_bi_pass_the_manpower_act_desc:0 "Due to historic wage agreements, different rates of pay are draining many essential industries of skilled workers. Attempts to renegotiate these terms are meeting overt resistance and strikes. This act allows us to transfer our scarce workforce to work of national importance, including Maori and women. In effect industrial conscription, our country's sense of shared sacrifice allows us to take this measure."
 NZL_bi_ratana_alliance:0 "Ratana Alliance"
 NZL_bi_ratana_alliance_desc:0 "An agreement between our government and the Ratana movement will bring indigenous Maori into government."
 NZL_bi_maori_conscription:0 "Maori Conscription"
 NZL_bi_maori_conscription_desc:0 "Indigenous Maori have not been conscripted, for a number of reasons including their high rate of volunteering and lack of official records. The valour of the Maori battalion shows that the time has come to draft our entire population, despite the practical difficulties involved."
 NZL_bi_mewo:0 "Maori War Effort Organisation"
 NZL_bi_mewo_desc:0 "Lack of trust in officialdom and poor records limit our ability to coordinate the Maori workforce. Pariire Paikea and other Maori leaders propose Tribal committees with good local knowledge to promote recruitment into industry and the military. Historically, increased food production was their greatest achievement."
 # Rearmament
 NZL_bi_early_rearmament:0 "Planning a War Economy"
 NZL_bi_early_rearmament_desc:0 "Our people desire only peace, but the clouds of war gather over Europe. Although unpopular, we can use our government's popularity to start preparing. Historically, only some planning work was done prewar."
 NZL_bi_peace_to_war:0 "From Peace to War"
 NZL_bi_peace_to_war_desc:0 "Our peacetime suppliers have diverted production to their own needs. We must develop our military industry to become more self-sufficient."
 NZL_bi_military_factory:0 "Military Industry"

 # War Economy
 NZL_bi_cool_storage:0 "Increase Refrigerated Storage"
 NZL_bi_cool_storage_desc:0 "We are a farming nation with 30 million sheep and 2 million dairy cows, and in times of war shipping may be in short supply. Our largest contribution to the war effort is to continue supplies of vital food for citizens and soldiers abroad. Being able to store perishable food is critical for sustaining our economy and supplying our allies."
 NZL_bi_duplicate_rolling_mill:0 "Steel and Iron"
 NZL_bi_duplicate_rolling_mill_desc:0 "We have a steel rolling mill in Dunedin, a mothballed iron mine with rich deposits of high-grade iron ore in Onekaka, and the famous West Coast ironsands. Currently we are reliant on imported iron. But we can recommence local iron smelting and duplicate the rolling mill, to feed the demands of our economy."
 NZL_bi_canning:0 "Develop Canning Capacity"
 NZL_bi_canning_desc:0 "Canned meat does not need refrigerated space, and there is a great demand for rations for American forces in the Pacific. Historically, meat canning expanded throughout the war, especially in response to the American Pacific campaign."
 NZL_bi_meat_focus:0 "Meat and Dairy Focus"
 NZL_bi_meat_focus_desc:0 "Wool was a primary export earner pre-war. But now the European market is gone, and with the loss of European food exports and the Amercian war effort, the demand for meat and diary products world-wide has greatly increased. Our friends clamour for nourishment, and we can shift our farming focus accordingly."
 NZL_bi_taranaki_oil:0 "Taranaki Oil Fields"
 NZL_bi_taranaki_oil_desc:0 "We have the oldest oil well in the Commonwealth in Moturoa, albeit one of the smallest. Many have tried and failed to drill other wells in the region. But many are convinced there are significant reserves in the region, just awaiting a rigorous effort to find."
 # War Production
 NZL_bi_colonial_ammunition:0 "Colonial Ammunition Company"
 NZL_bi_colonial_ammunition_desc:0 "New Zealand's only industrial manufacturer of ammunition at war's start. They operate an extensive facility and are prepared to expand production."
 NZL_bi_charlton:0 "Charlton Motor Workshops"
 NZL_bi_charlton_desc:0 "British weapons are in short supply as the UK rearms. An engineer by the name of Philip Charlton has developed a kit to convert Boer War-era rifles into light machine guns. Historically 1500 were built. Although considered inferior to a new-built Bren, it was available, lighter and worked perfectly and reliably during testing."
 NZL_bi_truck_assembly_plant:0 "Truck Assembly Plants"
 NZL_bi_truck_assembly_plant_desc:0 "We have a number of assembly plants for cars and trucks, most in the Wellington region. We can expand production by manufacturing licensed parts in small workshops, and using our existing plants for assembly."
 NZL_bi_armor_effort:0 "Local Production"
 NZL_bi_armor_effort_desc:0 "We can develop our subcontracting further, producing and assemblying components for armoured cars and other light armoured vehicles, both licensed and home-designed. Historically 1300 tracked carriers, and other vehicles, were produced."
 NZL_bi_domestic_designs:0 "Domestic Designs"
 NZL_bi_domestic_designs_desc:0 "With foreign sales cut off, a number of citizens have proposed basic light tank designs we can construct ourselves, including the infamous Bob Semple design. Historically the best of these was the Schofield tank. Prototyped quickly by motivated individuals in a country without prior armour design, these were lacking compared to contemporary major power models, but would have been better than no tank at all."
 NZL_bi_armor_vickers:0 "License Vickers Light Tank Design"
 NZL_bi_armor_vickers_desc:0 "Earlier Vickers designs have been widely exported, and produced under license by both Poland and the Soviet Union. Our friends in the Mother Country are willing for us to produce the Vickers Light Mk.VI under license."
 NZL_bi_armor_valentine:0 "License Valentine Tank Design"
 NZL_bi_armor_valentine_desc:0 "A reliable and well-protected tank design. Our developing tank industry can now handle larger castings and more complex suspensions. Historically the Valentine was produced under license in Canada, most of which were sent to the USSR."
 NZL_bi_armor_m3:0 "License M3 Lee Design"
 NZL_bi_armor_m3_desc:0 "Should British designs prove unsuitable or delayed, we can seek the assistance of the great Arsenal of Democracy. Historically, Canada built licensed M3 chassis for their Ram Tanks, although they did not see combat."
 NZL_bi_armor_m4:0 "License M4 Sherman Design"
 NZL_bi_armor_m4_desc:0 "The M3 was succeeded by the superior Sherman. Historically the Allies agreed to standardise on the M4, and Canada produced their own version under license as the Grizzly."
 # Manpower vs Industry

 NZL_bi_manpower_for_army_desc:0 "Our population is approaching total mobilisation. The needs of our armed forces must take priority."
 NZL_bi_manpower_for_industry:0 "Manpower to War Industry"
 NZL_bi_manpower_for_industry_desc:0 "Our population is approaching total mobilisation, including women and recent retirees. Although we lack prewar heavy industry, our workforce is highly educated and capable. We should focus on producing munitions for our alliance."
 NZL_bi_dilution_of_labour:0 "Dilution of Labour"
 NZL_bi_dilution_of_labour_desc:0 "Our greatest limitation is skilled labour, steelworkers in particular. We can spread our scarce skilled labour over more factories to help the supervision and rapid retraining of other trades."
 NZL_bi_NZR_armour:0 "NZ Railways"
 NZL_bi_NZR_armour_desc:0 "The railways workshops are the largest mechanical engineering establishment we have. We can send skilled labour to other factories to help supervise and train our workforce in mechanical engineering, although the maintenance of our railways will suffer given the unceasing demands of our war effort. Difficult decisions need to be made."
 NZL_bi_NZR_rail:0 "Focus on Logistics"
 NZL_bi_NZR_rail_desc:0 "We can spare some steelworkers to help supervise elsewhere, but our railways should focus on what they do best."
 NZL_bi_NZR_ships:0 "Shift Steelworkers to Shipyards"
 NZL_bi_NZR_ships_desc:0 "This war will be won far from our shores. We can divert some of our skilled railway workshop engineers to our shipyards."
 # Salvaging and Substitution
 NZL_bi_wartime_requisition:0 "Wartime Requisition"
 NZL_bi_wartime_requisition_desc:0 "The needs of our common defence require us to mobilise civilian resources. We can requisition and refurbish civilian cars, trucks and rifles for our defence, with compensation to be provided at a later date."
 NZL_bi_armor_salvage:0 "Desert War Salvage"
 NZL_bi_armor_salvage_desc:0 "The spoils of war belong to the victor. Our forces in the field have 'acquired' some damaged or abandoned tanks and other armoured vehicles of various types. These can be put back in the field under new ownership with a modest amount of effort."
 NZL_bi_rubber_reclaimation:0 "Reclaim Rubber"
 NZL_bi_rubber_reclaimation_desc:0 "Reclaimed tyres can fill many gaps in the supply of raw rubber. Historically, rubber equivalent to two years' pre-war imports was reclaimed and used."

 NZL_bi_2NZEF:0 "Form the 2NZEF"
 NZL_bi_2NZEF_desc:0 "Our peacetime army was organised in a division structure so an expeditionary division could be formed on mobilisation, with the peacetime units remaining for home defence. HQ and Support units existed but were in no fit state to send functioning units overseas. With effort this hypothetical organisation can be made a reality."
 NZL_bi_home_guard:0 "Form the Home Guard"
 NZL_bi_home_guard_desc:0 "Following the UK example, volunteer groups have started self-organising, including Farmer's Union and Returned Servicemen groups. We can bring these under the control of the government."

 NZL_bi_operations_middle_east:0 "Planning Focus for Middle East"
 NZL_bi_operations_middle_east_desc:0 "Just as we fought in the Suez, Sinai and Palestine in the Great War, so we may be asked to fight again in the scorching sands. Our lines of supply are shorter here, and the Commonwealth sees us as hardy colonials suited to hard terrain."
 NZL_bi_operations_pacific:0 "Planning Focus for Pacific"
 NZL_bi_operations_pacific_desc:0 "Our home cannot be neglected. The security of the Pacific has always required any attacker from the North to be delayed until the Royal Navy can muster it's strength."

 NZL_bi_expand_rnzaf_desc:0 "With rising tensions in Europe, a measured expansion of our air arm is prudent."
 NZL_bi_independent_rnzaf:0 "An Independent RNZAF"
 NZL_bi_independent_rnzaf_desc:0 "The NZ Permanent Air Force was renamed the RNZAF in 1934 following royal permission, but remains under Army control. Our growing air force must be able to evolve independently of the army if we are to take full advantage of airpower."
 NZL_bi_airfield_construction:0 "Airfield Construction"
 NZL_bi_airfield_construction_desc:0 "We will need to construct new airfields, not just for immediate defence, but also to hold our training establishments."
 NZL_bi_fighter_focus:0 "Local Defence"
 NZL_bi_fighter_focus_desc:0 "Within our limited means we seek to defend ourselves and our friends. Theorists hold that 'The bomber will always get through', but our politicians abhor such a focus on aggression. We can chart our own course."
 NZL_bi_bomber_focus:0 "Cochrane Report"
 NZL_bi_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The Government has commissioned a review of Air Defence requirements. The Cochrane Report suggests that medium bomber squadrons can both defend shipping routes and support British forces overseas. This seems eminently sensible."

 # Singapore
 NZL_bi_singapore_focus:0 "The Singapore Strategy"
 NZL_bi_singapore_focus_desc:0 "From the 1920's our core defence policy has been to rely on Royal Navy assistance, sustained by a fortified naval base. It's status as a symbol of Imperial commitment helped obscure the growing strategic weaknesses in the strategy. Historically New Zealand helped fund the Naval base, which was finished in 1939."
 NZL_bi_singapore_forts:0 "Contribute to Landward Forts"
 NZL_bi_singapore_forts_desc:0 "For better or for worse, work on the grandly-named 'Fortress Singapore' goes slowly. The Singapore Strategy as written requires Australasia to hold on until the Royal Navy can arrive. Contributing to defence works is an option we can choose. Historically the UK started work on ground fortifications, unfinished when invasion occurred."
 # Naval Tree
 NZL_bi_navy_doctrine:0 "Maritime Strategy"
 NZL_bi_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "We are a small country dependent on the sea to sell the products of our labour, and receive vital imports. Freedom of the seas is critical for our survival. How or if we go about contributing to this is upto us."

 NZL_bi_minesweepers:0 "Construct Minesweepers"
 NZL_bi_minesweepers_desc:0 "Rearmament has begun, and there is a never-ending demand for escorts and other small ships. We can make plans to construct minesweepers to protect our ports and trade, which will also give our shipbuilders valuable experience."
 NZL_bi_fairmiles:0 "Patrol Craft"
 NZL_bi_fairmiles_desc:0 "Our waters need defenders. As a wartime expedient we can rapidly retrain skilled labour from other trades under shipwright supervision and construct smaller craft. Historically motor launches were constructed that saw service in the island campaigns. In total nearly 500 vessels were constructed during the war, and at least partial repairs done on over 1000 US ships."

 NZL_bi_us_programme:0 "United States Programme"
 NZL_bi_us_programme_desc:0 "The United States has enquired whether our country can construct smaller craft such as tow boats, tugs and powered lighters for the Pacific. We have no steel-workers not already engaged on essential work.

 # Island Defence
 NZL_bi_fiji_focus:0 "Defence of the Local Islands"
 NZL_bi_fiji_focus_desc:0 "Our means may be limited, but we can still look to our own defence. To the west lies the bulwark of Australia. The most direct threat to our trade and freedom will come from the north. We can build a base in Fiji to help protect our coastal waters."

 NZL_bi_develop_relations_with_us:0 "Develop Relations with US"
 NZL_bi_develop_relations_with_us_desc:0 "Tension and growing conflict across the globe leaves us ever more isolated. Our country needs strong friends, and the US is strong. Historically this occurred during the close cooperation with the US needed during the Pacific campaign, and the reality of a US-dominated Pacific after the end of the war."
 NZL_bi_project_seal:0 "Project Seal"
 NZL_bi_project_seal_desc:0 "An American naval officer, Cmdr Gibson, has suggested testing the use of carefully placed explosives to create a large wave to damage coastal defences. We can conduct further tests. Historically the technology proved to be feasible, but inefficient."

 NZL_bi_john_lee:0 "John A. Lee"
 NZL_bi_john_lee_desc:0 "A decorated war amputee from WW1, Lee is an avowed socialist and influential politician.

 NZL_bi_license_polikarpov_desc:0 "The Soviet Government is willing to strike a deal that allows us to produce a Polikarpov fighter design. While these are more traditional biplanes, the experience will help us develop our own aviation industry. Historically over 200 I-15's were produced by Spain in the 1930's."
 NZL_bi_plan_intervention:0 "Planning for Intervention"
