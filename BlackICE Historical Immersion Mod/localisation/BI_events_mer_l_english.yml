The Jewish paramilitary organization known as the Irgun claims responsibility for the bombing, but blames the British for the deaths in light of their not responding to the warnings.

Leaders from across the Arab world have denounced the new country, some going so far as to threaten to invade along with the British. In spite of the danger, countless Jewish refugees from Europe are flocking to their new homeland. The future of this young nation is unclear, but no matter what happens, the repercussions will last well into the future."

This comes in response to an ultimatum, threatening war, from the Jews in the Mandate. With the Jewish state’s newfound independence, thousands of Jewish refugees from Europe are flocking to their new homeland. Although armed conflict has temporarily been avoided, many in the neighboring Arab nations are threatening war. What the future holds for the new Jewish state is unclear, but no matter what happens, this nation’s founding will change the region for a long time."

 mandate.10.t:0 "Arab General Strike"
 mandate.10.d:0 "The Arab community in Palestine is on strike! They are demanding changes in the Mandate’s policies, namely limiting Jewish immigration and limiting the purchase of Arab land by Jews. Those within the government who are calling for a violent crackdown are becoming more and more fervent as the strikes become increasingly violent to both the government and the Jewish population."
 mandate.10.a:0 "We may need help."
 mandate.11.t:0 "The Peel Commission"
 mandate.11.d:0 "Following the Arab General Strike and increasing violence in Palestine, the British have sent Lord Peel to investigate the causes of the strike as well as the motives of the conflicting Arabs and Jews in the Mandate.

 mandate.12.t:0 "The Peel Commission Publishes its Report"
 mandate.12.d:0 "After a year of review, the Peel Commission has concluded. Its report does not bode well. The commission has determined that “An irrepressible conflict has arisen between two national communities within the narrow bounds of one small country. There is no common ground between them. Their national aspirations are incompatible. The Arabs desire to revive the traditions of the Arab Golden Age. The Jews desire to show what they can achieve when restored to the land in which the Jewish nation was born. Neither of the two national ideals permits of combination in the service of a single State.” Strikes and revolts have resumed as both Arab and Jewish militias work to better arm themselves for the coming fight."

 mandate.13.t:0 "The White Paper"

The White Paper also stipulates the creation of a Jewish state within the next 10 years. Due to these new limitations, the Zionist community is outraged. Meanwhile, the Arab leadership, contrary to our expectations, is split on the issue. Amin al-Husayni is the only major supporter from the Arab High Committee of this new policy. The League of Nations has also refused to offer its support"
 mandate.13.a:0 "This is our new policy."
 mandate.13.a_tt:0 "The mandate will become more stable, fascist parties in the arab world will drop in popularity, members of the League of Nations will protest our actions"
 mandate.13.b:0 "No we must protect the Jewish people"
 mandate.13.b_tt:0 "The mandate will fall back into riots that we are unlikely to be able to contain, we are likely to loose any good relations with the Arab world as fascist parties will begin to take hold"
 mandate.14.t:0 "Special Night Squads"
 mandate.14.d:0 "As our need for Special Forces grows, so does Orde Wingate’s desire to experiment with new tactics. Orde Wingate trains the government-sponsored Jewish militias, and he has begun to work on Special Night Squad tactics. He has proposed the implementation of these special night teams into our standard armed forces."
 mandate.14.a:0 "Tell him to begin training at once."
 mandate.14.b:0 "He has a thousand silly ideas. Tell him to focus on training more men."
 mandate.14.b_tt:0 "Creates a small unit of militia"
 mandate.15.t:0 "End of the Arab Revolt"

 mandate.22.t:0 "Delay in Peel commission"
 mandate.22.d:0 "Although we had hoped the Peel commission's report would be ready by now it seems it will not publish until closer to the end of the year"
 mandate.24.t:0 "The White Papers are signed"
 mandate.24.d:0 "The unrest of the Arab Revolt has prompted British Parliament to approve the White Paper, a policy calling for limiting Jewish immigration into Palestine, and preventing the sale of land from Arabs to Jews.

 bmpisrael.1.t:0 "Formation of the Israeli Defense Force"
 bmpisrael.1.d:0 "With the creation of our new nation, an army must also be created with it. Organizations such as the Haganah have long dreamed of defending Israel from foreign threats, and it has become the core of the new Israeli Defense Force.

 bmpisrael.2.t:0 "Calls for War" #The State of Israel has been formed
 bmpisrael.2.d:0 "Western colonial powers have neglected their former Arab subjects. The creation of Israel, a Jewish nation, is not just an insult to the Arabs living in Palestine, but more importantly, a threat. People across our nation are calling for war to liberate our brethren!"
 ###############The Arab League calls upon us to aid our brothers in Palestine, who are currently losing their homeland to the Israelites
 bmpisrael.2.a:0 "We should check our options." #We must help them!
 bmpisrael.3.t:0 "The Altalena Affair"
 bmpisrael.3.d:0 "Our government has worked hard to turn the many paramilitary organizations into the Israeli Defense Force. While the Irgun has resisted our efforts, until now, they have been fighting alongside the IDF. However, after their doomed efforts to use the Altalena to smuggle in French weapons for their fighters, and the uproar caused by the killing of Irgun members by the IDF in a dispute over these weapons, it is clear we can no longer allow a rogue army to function and make deals with foreign powers from within our borders."
 bmpisrael.3.a:0 "We should send them an ultimatum, “Join us or be destroyed.”"
 bmpisrael.3.b:0 "We cannot allow such a hostile group to join the IDF. We must destroy them now!"
 bmpisrael.4.t:0 "The End of the Arab-Israeli war"
