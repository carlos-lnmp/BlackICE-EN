 news.912.t:0 "Icelandic Independence"
 news.912.d:0 "Icelanders have long sought to establish their sovereignty separate from the Danish Crown and have now declared Independence. As the Republican democratic movements have failed in their efforts so far, many of the Nations young Men have taken to the underground Nationalists, who are supported according to some accounts by the Swedes. Apparently numerous meetings have been held between Icelandic Nationalists and Swedish NSAP representatives in Stockholm. What support the Icelanders have gotten is still unclear but most speculations seem to suggest Arms deliveries and Military training. These groups which call themselves \"Fjölnismenn\" overtook several institutions on the Island and have now declared Independence. The world is awaiting the Danish response."
 news.912.a:0 "How will the Danes respond?"
 news.912.b:0 "Good News!"
